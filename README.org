* taskwarrior2net

  This program reads the output of taskwarrior as standard input and
  transforms it to a network structure.

** uda's are supported

   this works similarly to tag and project, but without hierarchies
   and such.

** options

   There are two kinds of options. First, the network structure may be
   modified by the exclusion of a certain type of node or a special
   node.
   
   For example, every argument =-$something= leads to the exclusion of
   that tag, or project or whatever =$something= ist.

   And also =--$other= leads to the exclusion of all nodes or edges of
   type =$other=.
